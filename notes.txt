Why react is fast?
React uses Virtual dom which is the representation of the actual dom. React uses something known as reconsiliation. It 
is the process which uses diff algorithm to find out the difference between the trees(dom and virtual dom), 
and render only the updated portion.

Why we use key?
when we are using more than one same attribute. we use key so that react can understand which attribute i have to render.
lazzy loading/code spliting/dyanamic bundling - we will not load all the file when we are loading the app. we will load them when needed.
for eg:in makemytrip page we have flight section bydefault. so its not loaded train bus and other section with flight.
all other bundle will come when we click on them. so it will make our app very light and fast.
when we try to load component ondemand, react try to suspend it. for handle this we use "Suspense".
